# DUCT: Decentralized User Contract Token

Underlying DUDE and other DUNIIX apps is DUCT &mdash; Decentralized User Contract Token &mdash; a JSON string token employing both Signing & Cipher functions of RSA cryptographic scheme.

As such, a DUCT token has the equivalent effect of a signed document or statement from one party to another.

Multiple DUCT tokens can be grouped together to form a legal agreement.

The most important feature of DUCT token is its decentralized nature &mdash; it can be generated without login into ANY existing web site or app.
