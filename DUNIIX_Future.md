# DUNIIX 2025

## Socratic Dialectic for Questioning & Shaping the Future

Here is a mass psychology test for all, from non programmers to experts:

- A. Do you believe that technological progress in the next 5 years would be greater than the past 5 years?
- B. Do you believe that income gaps in the next 5 years will improve compared to the past 5 years?
- C. If your answer for B is positive, what are the technological or non-technological factors that you think will contribute to B?
- D. Do you believe that what you currently believe or do not believe about the future will shape the future?
- E. Take (I) Android, (II) Bitcoin and (III) China's dominance in technologies by 2021 for examples, what were your believes about them in 2010 or 2000? Do you believe that the people who believed and supported them were instrumental in producing the outcome, or do you believe that they all happened due to random chances?
- F. Combining questions C, D and E, what are your predictions for 2025 and 2030? What or who will emerge as winners of technologies in 2025 and 2030? Will you play a role in the outcomes?

Asking you the right questions may be more convincing than preaching to you with lengthy arguments, for we believe you would have your own ability and access to data to find the answers, but what you need are not answers, but questions that may guide your thoughts. 

We may call this an extension of Socratic Dialectic: Questions about the future which affect our believes to shape it.

## Uneditied Notes

Our own opinion for Question B for the past 5 years (improvement / narrowing of income gaps) have not been optimistic.

Success of DUNIIX in 2025 depends on number of people who believe in C.

There are people who deny B and refuse to even consider any possible solution in C.

One realistic application scenario would be to use GitHub as temporary storage to relay the IP address of SSH tunnel set up by applications such as ngrok. Once obtained from GitHub, the IP address of the DUDE server running behind the SSH tunnel can be used by DUDE clients. 

A long term solution for DUDE would be to set up VPS (virtual private server) for shared SSH tunnels at centres of population. Subsequently, a theoretical upper limit of 65535 ports can be used for SSH tunnels per fixed IP VPS to host DUDE servers.

Add GUI

Mobile app

USE DUDE to pay DUDE and other projects.

Long term DUNIIX plan

DUNIIX --- the LAST Free Software Revolution?

As big as Bitcoin in half the time? 99.9% people without wallet. Assume < 0.1% have a wallet, get 5 times more people to have access to Cryptocurrencies via DUDE in 5 years?

Replicate MAGA+F in 5 years? Static goal posts.

Here is a mass psychology test for all, from non programmers to experts:

1. Do you believe that technological progress in the next 5 years would be greater than the past 5 years?
2. Do you believe that income gaps in the next 5 years will improve compared to the past 5 years?

But we are pessimistic about narrowing of income gaps, aren't we, although we may find it easier to believe technological progress in the next 5 years would be greater than the past 5 years.

Final decision is acceptance of DUNIIX or similar projects. If you don't accept and promote it, the consequences are your responsibility.

Linux grew because of demand of web servers. Not AGAINST corporate interests.

But will DUNIIX grow AGAINST corporate interests?

Grow DUNIIX apps first that is NOT AGAINST corporate interests.

Then there will be capital to grow other apps AGAINST corporate interests.

Political forces behind DUNIIX, lobby parliaments.
