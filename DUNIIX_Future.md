# DUNIIX 2025

Here is a mass psychology test for all, from non programmers to experts:

- A. Do you believe that technological progress in the next 5 years would be greater than the past 5 years?
- B. Do you believe that income gaps in the next 5 years will improve compared to the past 5 years?
- C. If your answer for B is positive, what are the technological or non-technological factors do you think will contribute to B?

Our own opinion for Question B for the past 5 years (improvement / narrowing of income gaps) have not been optimistic.


One realistic application scenario would be to use GitHub as temporary storage to relay the IP address of SSH tunnel set up by applications such as ngrok. Once obtained from GitHub, the IP address of the DUDE server running behind the SSH tunnel can be used by DUDE clients. 

A long term solution for DUDE would be to set up VPS (virtual private server) for shared SSH tunnels at centres of population. Subsequently, a theoretical upper limit of 65535 ports can be used for SSH tunnels per fixed IP VPS to host DUDE servers.

Add GUI

Mobile app

USE DUDE to pay DUDE and other projects.

Long term DUNIIX plan

DUNIIX --- the LAST Free Software Revolution?

As big as Bitcoin in half the time? 99.9% people without wallet. Assume < 0.1% have a wallet, get 5 times more people to have access to Cryptocurrencies via DUDE in 5 years?

Replicate MAGA+F in 5 years? Static goal posts.

Here is a mass psychology test for all, from non programmers to experts:

1. Do you believe that technological progress in the next 5 years would be greater than the past 5 years?
2. Do you believe that income gaps in the next 5 years will improve compared to the past 5 years?

But we are pessimistic about narrowing of income gaps, aren't we, although we may find it easier to believe technological progress in the next 5 years would be greater than the past 5 years.

Final decision is acceptance of DUNIIX or similar projects. If you don't accept and promote it, the consequences are your responsibility.

Linux grew because of demand of web servers. Not AGAINST corporate interests.

But will DUNIIX grow AGAINST corporate interests?

Grow DUNIIX apps first that is NOT AGAINST corporate interests.

Then there will be capital to grow other apps AGAINST corporate interests.

Political forces behind DUNIIX, lobby parliaments.
