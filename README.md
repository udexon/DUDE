# DUDE
- DUDE: Decentralized User Centric Donation Scheme &mdash; the _OnlyFans_ clone for Programmers, but better.

Let's face it: 

- _NO free software programmers since Richard Stallman has been able to create a universal donation scheme to allow free software programmers to receive donations in small amounts from arbitrary donors._

__... UNTIL NOW THAT IS ...__

In true free software spirit, we shall make the source code available. You are of course free to improve it.

One must highlight the on-going irony &mdash; where an OnlyFans (Ex)-Catholic school mom makes USD 150k a month, while the greats of github and the free software world are literally doing ___worse than whores___ .... (pardon the language as this is the best way to get the message across!)

## DUDE & DUNIIX

Experienced programmers will be able to set up DUDE/DUNIIX web app in 5 minutes, as it is just plain old PHP & JavaScript.

A brief glance over DUDE source code should reveal to readers that, although not being rocket science, several design decisions go against the well established norms, which explain why no one has been able to create such a universal donation or payment system.

- _Going against established norms_ .... Is that legal?

Younger programmers have not experienced first hands the proverbial fire of revolution against the commercial software establishment in the 1990s.

Forgetting the threats from Mega Corporations such as Microsoft Amazon Google Apple Facebook (MAGA+F) is itself an even bigger threat.

At the height of the Free Software Revolution (1.0), the then Microsoft CEO Steve Baller (in)famously accused Linux as "Communism", something which some of our comrades take pride in.

The world has since witnessed at least 2 "great victories" for Free Software, ___BUT___ not for (individual) Free Software Programmers, namely:

1. the establishment of the Android operating system and its ecosystem
2. the rise of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies

These "victories" proved that the free software (open source) development model is viable and essential, but the "last mile" (a term borrowed from the old telephone industry, for laying the cables to homes) that can reward and benefit individual programmers has been elusive.

Experts who can analyse DUDE source code may verify that DUDE has the following features that break the dilemma：

1. Decentralized User Authentication based on public key cryptography
2. The use of metaprogramming scripts to simplify GUI, web, mobile and back-end programming


## DU = Decentralized User Centric

We will just wrap up this article with an explanation of the names DUDE and DUNIIX, together with a link to the next tutorial, conforming to the new "TikTok attention span" rule:

- We have decided to prefix our apps with the letters DU for "Decentralized User Centric" as we view blockchain technologies as only "half decentralized", as each blockchain are in fact "centralized to itself".

- DUNIIX is the name we use as a pun to the "father of all evils" UNIX system, against which Richard Stallman coined "GNU is Not Unix". "-II-" is used in the name to avoid legal confusions with existing DUNIX names.
