# DUDE
- DUDE: Decentralized User Centric Donation Scheme &mdash; the _OnlyFans_ clone for Programmers, but better.

Let's face it: 

- _NO free software programmers since Richard Stallman has been able to create a universal donation scheme to allow free software programmers to receive donations in small amounts from arbitrary donors._

__... UNTIL NOW THAT IS ...__

In true free software spirit, we shall make the source code available. You are of course free to improve it.

One must highlight the on-going irony &mdash; where an OnlyFans (Ex)-Catholic school mom makes USD 150k a month, while the greats of github and the free software world are literally doing ___worse than whores___ .... (pardon the language as this is the best way to get the message across!)

## DUDE & DUNIIX

Experienced programmers will be able to set up DUDE/DUNIIX web app in 5 minutes, as it is just plain old PHP & JavaScript.

A brief glance over DUDE source code should reveal to readers that, although not being rocket science, several design decisions go against the well established norms, which explain why no one has been able to create such a universal donation or payment system.

- _Going against established norms_ .... Is that legal?

Younger programmers have not experienced first hands the proverbial fire of revolution against the commercial software establishment in the 1990s.

Forgetting the threats from Mega Corporations such as Microsoft Amazon Google Apple Facebook (MAGA+F) is itself an even bigger threat.

At the height of the Free Software Revolution (1.0), the then Microsoft CEO Steve Baller (in)famously accused Linux as "Communism", something which some of our comrades take pride in.

The world has since witnessed at least 2 "great victories" for Free Software, ___BUT___ not for (individual) Free Software Programmers, namely:

1. the establishment of the Android operating system and its ecosystem
2. the rise of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies

These "victories" proved that the free software (open source) development model is viable and essential, but the "last mile" (a term borrowed from the old telephone industry, for laying the cables to homes) that can reward and benefit individual programmers has been elusive.

Experts who can analyse DUDE source code may verify that DUDE has the following features that break the dilemma：

1. Decentralized User Authentication based on public key cryptography
2. The use of metaprogramming scripts to simplify GUI, web, mobile and back-end programming


## DU = Decentralized User Centric

We will just wrap up this article with an explanation of the names DUDE and DUNIIX, together with a link to the next tutorial, conforming to the new "TikTok attention span" rule:

1. We have decided to prefix our apps with the letters DU for "Decentralized User Centric" as we view blockchain technologies as only "half decentralized", as each blockchain are in fact "centralized to itself".

2. DUNIIX is the name we use as a pun to the "father of all evils" UNIX system, against which Richard Stallman coined "GNU is Not Unix". "-II-" is used in the name to avoid legal confusions with existing DUNIX names.

3. Underlying DUDE and other DUNIIX apps is DUCT — Decentralized User Contract Token — a JSON string token employing both Signing & Cipher functions of RSA cryptographic scheme.

As such, a DUCT token has the equivalent effect of a signed document or statement from one party to another.

Multiple DUCT tokens can be grouped together to form a legal agreement.

The most important feature of DUCT token is its decentralized nature — it can be generated without login into ANY existing web site or app.

In the next tutorial, we shall demonstrate how DUCT token can be generated, as part of the process to complete a DUDE transaction:

## Slogans, Components, Plans

Readers want to know components (must know to understand project, how they work) and plans (what, when to do to deliver project) of project beside slogans (to excite emotion).

Must have balance (not just contetns, but visually, layout too), don't let any of slogans, components, plans dominate. Else will lead to bad impression or misunderstanding.

## Plans

1. Multiple Agents to complete payment transaction

Transactions between multiple individuals or parties are made up of many steps, which may or may not be quantified, depending on the needs and costs of implementation as computer software systems.

DUCT provides a mechanism to quantify these steps of transactions, as a system with a decentralized architecture, thus allowing the possibilities of greater competitions amongst agents, resulting in significant reduction of overall costs.

Consider a transaction where Adam in New York city decides to tip Brian in Bangkok an amount of USD 10. Using conventional money transfer or cryptocurrency, the commission fees will be prohibitively high.

In a yet to be implemented DUDE network, Adam and Brian first exchange DUCT tokens, confirming the willingness to pay and receive USD 10, without specifying the actual methods of payment


3. Using github (or any public website, e.g. Twitter, Reddit) as temporary storage, until setting up SSH tunnels
