# DUDE
DUDE: Decentralized User Centric Donation Scheme &mdash; the _OnlyFans_ clone for Programmers, but better

Let's face it: 

- _ALL free software programmers since Richard Stallman have not been able to create a universal donation scheme to allow free software programmers to receive donations in small amounts from arbitrary donors._

__... UNTIL NOW THAT IS ...__

In true free software spirit, we shall make the source code available. You are of course free to improve it.

One must highlight the on-going irony &mdash; where an OnlyFans (Ex)-Catholic school mom makes USD 150k a month, while the greats of github and the free software world are literally doing ___worse than whores___ .... (pardon the language as this is the best way to get the message across!)

## DUDE & DUNIIX

Experienced programmers will be able to set up DUDE/DUNIIX web app in 5 minutes, as it is just plain old PHP & JavaScript.

A brief glance over DUDE source code should reveal to readers that, although not being rocket science, several design decisions go against the well established norms, which explain why no one has been able to create such a universal donation or payment system.

_Going against established norms_ .... Is that legal?

Younger programmers have not experienced first hands the proverbial fire of revolution against the commercial software establishment in 1990s.

Forgetting the threats from Mega Corporations such as Microsoft Amazon Google Apple Facebook (MAGA+F) is itself an even bigger threat.

At the height of the Free Software Revolution (1.0), the then Microsoft CEO Steve Baller (in)famously accused Linux as "Communism", something which some of our comrades take pride in.

The world has since witnessed at least 2 "great victories" for Free Software, ___BUT___ not for Free Software Programmers, namely:

1. establishment of the Android operating system and its ecosystem
2. the rise of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies
